# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application from
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

I have uploaded this project to Github for purely educational purposes and future reference.
